Hello there,

How to use this:

Bot:
	Right now you can not use the bot on your own. Sorry buddy.

Webserver:
	1. Go into the webserver directory.
	2. Change the config file to match YOUR paramters.
	3. "./serverctl.sh start" to start the server.
		+ Use "./serverctl.sh stop" to stop the server
		* NOTE: These commands only work on *nix! If youre running this
			webserver on windows you will have to manually start and stop
			the server! If you are on windows, use ./tswebserver insead

Manager:
	The manager is pretty much only for me to use right now.
